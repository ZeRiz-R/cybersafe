Module registration must be completed by 6 October 2025. This can be done by signing into the [color={link}][hint=https://tabula.warwick.ac.uk]login portal[/hint][/color] and navigating to the Modules tab. If you require advice for module selection, please refer to the [color={link}][hint=https://warwick.ac.uk/modules]module webpages[/hint][/color] or contact module supervisors directly. Note that late module registration will cause delays to your university timetable release.

Kind regards,

Administration Team
University of Warwick"
